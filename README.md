Welcome to Lab 7 of CSE3150

Copy the program by using git clone followed by the URL of the git repo.

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.

To compile program: g++ -o main main.cpp double_vector.cpp double_read_vector.cpp -lm

To run program: ./main vectors.txt

To compile unit tests: g++ -o tests tests.cpp double_vector.cpp double_read_vector.cpp

To run unit tests: ./tests

For the vectors.txt file, I used the example 5D vector provided to us, the output matches the one in the PDF.
